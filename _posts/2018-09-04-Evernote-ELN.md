title: Evernote as an Electronic Lab Notebook
author: Tim
---

As a graduate student, I documented all my experiments in a classic hardcopy lab notebook. But since we live in the digital age, I ended up printing all my figures and notes from my computer on paper, only to paste it into the hardcopy notebook. Consequently, I was looking for software alternatives and the solution seemed clear: an electronic lab notebook (ELN).  Some of them like Benchling come with pretty cool features e.g. nucleotide sequence viewer/editor. However, after about one month of using benchling it dawned me that I might just as well use Evernote, which I've been using almost daily anyway.

## Why choose Evernote over a dedicated ELN?

### 1. It's simple and efficient

If you're already using Evernote for note taking, it's almost a no-brainer to use it also as ELN. Learning another software tool, switching between different software and tabs in your browser - all unnecessary. Keep it simple! Be efficient!

### 2. Evernote was made for note taking

The essence of Evernote is its excellent note taking and organization functionality. It's ideal for managing your projects - whether they are scientific, personal, or more business-like. Doesn't matter, Evernote is the way to go. It's search function is astounding and the premium feature are excellent. ELNs are often overblown with additional features that may be nice to have but are rarely needed. As a result, the core note taking functionality will suffer from that. Don't compromise!

### 3. Keep using your specialized software

This point is directly related to the previous one. ELNs advertize with special features like sequence editors, spreadsheet functionality, and others. While it's nice to play around with such tools, they are very basic and you'll reach their limitations quite fast. There's no reason to abandon your favorite sequence editor or spreadsheet software. Plus, often all lab members use the same software because it makes exchanging files so much easier. Use the tools that give you the most control of what you want to to!

## How to use Evernote as ELN

### 1. Getting started: Create a new notebook

This seems obvious, but I think it's important to have your professional notes somehow separated from your private ones. Especially when you want to export your whole lab notebook at some point (e.g. when your PI wants a copy), it's much simpler when you've a dedicated lab notebook in Evernote.

### 2. Name your notes wisely

Because Evernote's search feature is so powerful, you should make it a habit to name your notes in a coherent, organized way. I for example name every experiment with my initials plus a sequential 3-digit number followed by a descriptive title, e.g. "TD 123 - Western blot test of new antibody XYZ". Notes from a group meeting would be titled "Group meeting - 01.08.2018 John presented". A protocol will always start with "Protocol - ...". You get the idea. Your future self will invite you for a beer for sticking to coherent naming patterns. This way you will be able to find a specific note, easily.

These are the most common note title formats I use:

- "TD 000 - ..."  (Experiments)
- "Protocol - ... "
- "Lab meeting - date..."
- "Note - "  (e.g. Seminars, lectures )
- "Sketch - ..."  (e.g. Pseudo code, email drafts, ...)



### 3. Use Tags efficiently

Use tags as a higher order level of organization for your notes. Some tags may be redundant if you already stick to coherent note titles, but in many cases tags are quite useful. E.g. you might want to use a "Reseach Idea" tag with which you want to label any note that contains ideas you may want to follow up in your own future research. Of course, these ideas can come up under different circumstances including meetings with the PI, during a keynote lecture at conference, or while you are under the shower. No problem, the "Research Idea" tag will bundle them together.

Some ideas for efficient Tags:

- Project name (this way you can group all experiments of a given project)
- Experiment
- Protocol
- Sketch
- Research Idea
- Meetings & Seminars



### 4. Learn some keyboard shurtcuts

A very useful shortcut is the insert date command: "cmd+d" (Mac) or "ctrl+d" (Win) 

I use this frequently e.g. when I add something new to an ongoing experiment. To orient myself better, I add a horizontal line after each new date.

Other useful shortcuts can be found on the [Evernote Keyboard Shortcuts Cheatsheet](https://www.maketecheasier.com/premium/cheatsheet/evernote-keyboard-shortcuts/) on maketecheasier.

### 5. The Ideas Log - A special note

Surely, it sometimes happens that you have a great idea you might want to follow up in the future but you never follow it up. The Ideas Log note will prevent that. Everytime you come up with a potential experiment, a possible new area of research or a business idea, simply drop it into the Ideas Log note. A great side effect will be, that you train your creativity be frequently writing down your ideas.

### 6. Transfer written notes to Evernote

If you're old school about taking notes on paper during a seminar or meeting, that's perfectly fine! A way to implement this is scanning your paper notes (or taking a picture with your phone) and attaching it to a note in Evernote. Name the note accordingly and add some keywords. This way you'll be able to easily access your hand-written notes as well.

### 7. Try Plus or Premium

Check out Evernote's Plus and Premium features. Some of the most useful ones are the following:

- Additional storage space, which is a must-have if you insert lots of images and other files to your notes
- Better PDF support
- Presentation mode

*PS: I'm perfectly aware of the other notebook apps out there (e.g. Microsoft OneNote). If you're already using another note taking software, please keep using it and try if it works as an ELN for you!*
